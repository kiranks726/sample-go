# Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Serverless Stack](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/packages/create-serverless-stack).

1. Start by installing the dependencies.

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

2. Setup proper AWS profile either in `~/.aws/credentials`. This app is setup for `ctx11` profile name. If this changes make sure to update in the first line of the `Makefile`

3. To start with local development type `make start`. This will deploy a development stack in AWS and connect local machine to the stack for development. You can edit the files in `src` live. NOTE: The first deployment will take a while, but then it is pretty fast.
4. To deploy a build to AWS, run `make deploy`. This will deploy the stack to the AWS account prefixing the stack resources with the "dev" stage name. NOTE: The stage name can be changed if needed. The "dev" name helps to separate the "local" and "dev" resources in the target AWS account.
4. Type `make` or `make help` for additioanl details on commands to get started.


## Commands

### Make Commands

Use `make` for project specific commands.

NOTE: The make commanmds use AWS profile, `default`, for proper provisioning. Be sure to update the profile name in `Makefile` if you use a different AWS profile for provisioning.

#### `make help`

This will output a list of commands similar to the `npm` commands below, but lead with the `make` command.

* [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) - This is a basic layout for Go application projects. It's not an official standard defined by the core Go dev team.
    * This project bases many of the patterns on this "standard" project structure.
